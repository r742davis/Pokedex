Pokemon - Project 1 for General Assembly

This is a free-to-use Pokedex created with the PokeAPI!

You can find individual pokemon by either entering their name or number in the "Name/Number" input and clicking submit, or you ca generate a random pokemon by clicking the "Random Pokemon" button.

If you wish to search for a new pokemon, simply press the "Reset" button to clear the viewing field. Then you may search for a pokemon with the 2 previously defined methods.

If you search for a "Random Pokemon," you have the option to see the previous or next pokemon by clicking on the left or right arrows with the pokeballs respectively. You can cycle through the entire array of pokemon if you would like! (Individual search previous/next arrows are currently not functioning due to a bug)

Information Displayed

Any search will return multiple points of information about the pokemon including:
- ID number
- Name
- Type(s)
- Description
- Height
- Weight
- Abilities

Thank you for using my Pokedex! I hope you enjoy it!
